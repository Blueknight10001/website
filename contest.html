<p>You do not have to officially register for the course (6.148) to compete, as long as you are eligible. Therefore, you may compete even if you are taking another 12 unit class during IAP by not registering for the class. However, we strongly encourage that you register for the course so we have a count on the number of competitors for logistics.</p>

You may implement your own username/password login system or use an existing system (e.g. Facebook or Google login). The content and/or UI of the website should reflect whether a user is logged in.
