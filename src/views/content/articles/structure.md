The structure of web.lab can be split up into two phases.

### Phase 1: Learning
The first phase of web.lab lasts for the first two weeks of IAP. During this period staff teach lectures and run workshops every day. By the end, we build a fully-fledged website together with the students in the class. In the first week we walk through the basics of web development: how to program in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, how to launch a backend server using node.js, and how to integrate a database into your web-app using MongoDB. In the second week, we teach more advanced topics and sponsors give cool lectures on how students can utilize industry techniques and technoligies in their project.   

### Phase 2: Building
The second phase of web.lab is kicked off with a hackthon on the last day of lecture. From this point onwards we let students be to maximize time available to work on their websites! Staff host many office hours during this period and are constantly answering questions online.
